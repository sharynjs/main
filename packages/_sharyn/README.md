## Installation

```sh
npm i sharyn
# or
yarn add sharyn
```

If you use `sharyn/react-hooks` or `sharyn/react-router` which are included, you will need to install `react` and `react-router` too. They are not listed as `peerDependencies` to avoid noise in projects that want to use `sharyn` without React.
