## ðŸŒ¹ css

**`css`** is a template string tag that does **nothing**. It's a normal template string, but your code editor or its plugins ([es6-string-css](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bashmish.es6-string-css) for VSCode) might support syntax highlighting for HTML when they are marked with a `css` tag.

**`css`** is part of [`@sharyn/util`](https://github.com/sharynjs/sharyn-util/blob/master/README.md)
