## ðŸŒ¹ css

**`css`** is a template string tag that does almost nothing. It's a normal template string, but your code editor or its plugins might support syntax highlighting for HTML when they are marked with a `css` tag. The only thing it does is to `.trim()` your string so that you can put your template string on multiple lines without getting unwanted whitespace.

**`css`** is part of [`@sharyn/util`](https://github.com/sharynjs/sharyn-util/blob/master/README.md)
