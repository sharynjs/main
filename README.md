## Getting Started

Depending on your needs, you can install individual modules, like [`@sharyn/browser.getformfields`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sharyn/browser.getformfields), a group of modules, like [`@sharyn/browser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sharyn/browser), or the whole library (which is actually quite small, 379KB on disk, including all its dependencies). That's the simplest way to get started. The library is separated into 2 parts, `sharyn`, which goes in your `dependencies`, and `sharyn-dev`, which goes in your `devDependencies`.

```sh
npm i sharyn && npm i --save-dev sharyn-dev
# or
yarn add sharyn && yarn add --dev sharyn-dev
```

## Imports

And depending on what packages you chose to install, you have different ways to `import` or `require` a module:

```js
// If you installed an individual package (note the lowercase name)
import getFormFields from '@sharyn/browser.getformfields'

// If you installed a group of modules
import getFormFields from '@sharyn/browser/getFormFields'
import { getFormFields } from '@sharyn/browser'

// If you installed the whole library
import getFormFields from 'sharyn/browser/getFormFields'
import { getFormFields } from 'sharyn/browser'
import { getFormFields } from 'sharyn'
```

**Note**: If you use the `from 'sharyn'` syntax, you need to have `react` and `react-router` installed in your project, since some of the modules included in `sharyn` require them.

Also, TypeScript users, remember to have your `esModuleInterop` set to `true` if you want to import the default exports without having to use the `*` syntax.
